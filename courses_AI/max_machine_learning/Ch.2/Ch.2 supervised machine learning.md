# Supervised machine learning
- supervised machine learning is a group of algorithm we use when we have a labelled data
- because we know the answer of the prediction we can give the data to the machine learning model and we evaluate the result according to our part of the data and give a feedback
- Train the algorithm to predict a target value based on a set of values
- **model** : a model is a representation of reality
- they are not reality ,but they are designed to represent reality
- so there will be a difference of your model and the reality , so the algorithm is always at a continuous improvement
- **model** : refer to a specific algorithm trained to preform or solve a problem based on data
