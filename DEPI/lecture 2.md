# AWS pricing
- pricing according to 3 fundamentals
	1. compute 
	2. storage
	3. data transfer --> affected with regions 
					- inbound : in the same region
					- outbound : from a region to another

# how do you pay for AWS ?
- aws support the user with team(TCO) that will optimize the services to minimize the cost and increase the computation ability
1. pay what to use 
	- not always right 
	- only amateurs that pay for that 
1. pay less when you reserve
2. pay less when use more and as AWS grows

## pay less when you reserve 
- its more business than an individual or single user
- a way to buy storage and computational power 
- invest in reserved instances (RIs)
- save to 75%
- business uses that
* options 
1. AURI (all upfront reserve instance)
	- for big businesses that have stability and big budget
	- this will reserve big storage and alot of services
1. PURI (partial upfront reserve instance)
	- for startup business that have moderate save 
2. NURI (No upfront reserve instance)
	- small businesses that provide few services or one services that i will use

| AURI           | PURI                       | NURI                |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| big businesses | small , startup businesses | startup or personal |
## pay less as AWS grows
- the more I use the service the less I will pay 
- we pay for our usage , in case we pass the limit we will pay for more usage 

| pay less when you reserve | pay less as AWS grows |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| I pay while using         | I reserve then use    |

- AWS Free Tire --> free for a year 

# cons of AWS Cloud
- No upfront expense
- improve time 
- Scale Up and Down --> can set minimum and maximum usage when reserving the service , and the pay will be in the demand (according to my usage)
