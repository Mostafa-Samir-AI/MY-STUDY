| forever  | Runs the given set of statements forever                                                      |
| repeat   | Repeats the given set of statements for a given number of times                               |
| while    | Repeats the given set of statments as long as given condition is true                         |
| for      | Similar to while loop, but more condense and popular form                                     |
| do while | Repeats the given set of statements atleast once, and then loops as long as condition is true |
| foreach  | Used mainly to iterate through all elements in an array                                       |
## forever loop 
- its like a while loop with no break condition
- used to insert time delay in the design 
```c
module tb;

  initial begin
    
    forever begin
      #2 $display("hello mostafa");
    end
 
  end
  
  initial 
    #11 $finish;

endmodule
```
- output
```txt
hello mostafa  
hello mostafa  
hello mostafa  
hello mostafa  
hello mostafa  
$finish called from file "testbench.sv", line 12.  
$finish at simulation time 11
```

## repeat 
- repeats a code block with number
```c
module tb;
  initial begin
    // repeating a block 5 times
    repeat (5) begin
      $display("hello world");
    end
  end
endmodule
```
- output
```txt
hello world  
hello world  
hello world  
hello world  
hello world
```

## while loop 
- while the condition is true ---> execute the following block of code
```c
module tb;

  bit clk ; 
  
  always #10 clk = ~clk;
  
  initial begin
    bit [3:0] counter;
    $display ("Counter is equal to : %0d" , counter);
    
    while (counter <10) begin
      @(posedge clk);
      counter++;
      $display ("Counter = %0d" , counter);
    end
    
    $display ("Counter = %0d" , counter);
    $finish;
    
  end

endmodule
```
- output
```txt
Counter is equal to : 0  
Counter = 1  
Counter = 2  
Counter = 3  
Counter = 4  
Counter = 5  
Counter = 6  
Counter = 7  
Counter = 8  
Counter = 9  
Counter = 10  
Counter = 10  
$finish called from file "testbench.sv", line 18.  
$finish at simulation time 190 NS
```
- **lets** **explain**
	- `#10 clk = ~clk` the simulator will generate a clock cycle each 20 NS
	- **while block** will check if the condition is true and will execute the code inside
	- `@posedge` <u>when a rise in the clock happens , execute the block below</u> 
	- so the rise in the clock will occurs every 20NS
	- so 20 * 10 = 200 NS , actual 190 NS --> the last negative clk is not counted
## do while loop
- execute a block of code first then check the condition 
```c
module tb;
  bit clk ; 
  always #10 clk = ~clk;
  
  initial begin
    bit [3:0] counter;
    $display ("Counter is equal to : %0d" , counter);
    
      do begin 
      @(posedge clk);
      $display ("Counter = %0d" , counter);
      counter ++ ;
      end while (counter < 5);
    
    $display ("Counter = %0d" , counter);
    $finish;
    
  end
endmodule
```
- output
```txt
Counter is equal to : 0  
Counter = 0  
Counter = 1  
Counter = 2  
Counter = 3  
Counter = 4  
Counter = 5
```
## for loop 
- counter + condition + increment expression all in one line
```c
module tb;

  bit clk ; 
  
  always #10 clk = ~clk;
  
  initial begin
    bit [3:0] counter;
    $display ("Counter is equal to : %0d" , counter);
    
    for (counter = 0 ; counter < 14 ; counter = counter +2) begin
      
      @(posedge clk);
      
      $display ("Counter = %0d" , counter);
    
    end
    
    $display ("Counter = %0d" , counter);
    $finish;
    
  end

endmodule
```
- output 
```txt
Counter is equal to : 0  
Counter = 0  
Counter = 2  
Counter = 4  
Counter = 6  
Counter = 8  
Counter = 10  
Counter = 12  
Counter = 14  
$finish called from file "testbench.sv", line 20.  
$finish at simulation time 130
```
## foreach 
- iterating through each element in the iterable
```c
module tb;

  bit [7:0] array [8] ;
  
  initial begin
    // assign value for each index
    foreach (array [index]) begin
      array[index] = index ;
    end
    
    // printing the values
    foreach (array [index]) begin
      $display ("the value of index %0d is 0x%0d" , index , array[index]);
    end
  end

endmodule
```
- output 
```txt
the value of index 0 is 0x0  
the value of index 1 is 0x1  
the value of index 2 is 0x2  
the value of index 3 is 0x3  
the value of index 4 is 0x4  
the value of index 5 is 0x5  
the value of index 6 is 0x6  
the value of index 7 is 0x7
```
