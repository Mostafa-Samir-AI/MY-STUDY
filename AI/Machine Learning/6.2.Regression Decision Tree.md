# regression trees
- regression trees are types of Decision trees that work for continuous data (regression data)
- same as the Classification Decision tree it splits the data according to simple Decisions (threshold for each decision)

# How to build one 
- image we have data like 
	- features : ['drug dosage' , 'age' , 'sex']
	- target : effectiveness ---> numeric value
- we want to use the features to predict the target value

# splitting a feature 
## Let's start : first split
- at the beginning we will pick feature by feature and process it 
- let's start with the feature *drug dosage*

- when we look  at the graph we will notice that the data is not linear 
- the aim of this approach is to divide the data into continuous segments 
- it's a little bit of a cycle

### Step 1 : spot a threshold
- we will focus on the first 2 points 
- take their average (x-axis average = drug dosage)
- set the average as the threshold

### Step 2 : split and evaluate 

```text
the process can be summarized in few steps
	- take a threshold on x-axis
	- divide into 2 leaves
	- foreach leaf , calculate the average (target) for all leaf points
	- calculate the SSR (some of squared residuals) --> (actual - predicted)^2
```

- we split data according to the threshold we got into left and right leaves
	- **left leaf** : have a dosage less than `3` , and the average effectiveness is `0` 
	- **right leaf** : have a dosage more than `3` , and have average effectiveness `38.8`  
- then for each leaf we calculate the sum of squared residuals for all points $$\sum\ (actual - predicted)^2$$
- for each leaf
	- **left leaf** : SSR = 0
	- **right leaf** : SSR = 27,468.5

### Step 3 : plot the SSR on a graph
- we plot the SSR on a graph to visualize the value

### Step 4 : change threshold
- we will repeat the previous 3 steps with changing the threshold 
- at the end , using the SSR graph to pick the least SSR-to-threshold to be our main threshold for this feature

#### least SSR-to-threshold

## now : second split
- in the previous splitting we split the data into 2 nodes 
- we can go further to split into more nodes , taking each node as a whole and start the same processes mentioned previously to split it 

### left leaf

 - in the above image , we have done 2 splits using the same criteria

>[!multi-column]
>> [!warning] problem
>>- the tree above predicts the data very accurate 
>> - this causes overfitting , means the model have <u>low to no Bias but have high variance</u>
>
>> [!todo] solution
>> - **we decide the minimum number of points (records in the data) to split**
>> - usually its 20 , but in this case we will make it 7 
>> - so the left tree will remove the 2 additional splits we made and remains as a leaf node

### right leaf

# continue the process
- we continue the process of splitting 
- picking the least SSR in each feature to be the threshold to split on 
- taking all features SSR to compare it to each other 
- the feature with the least SSR become the Root feature

## Age feature

## Sex feature

# pick candidate 
- picking the feature to be the root node

![[Pasted image 20250104114204.png | center]]

- we notice that *age* feature have the least SSR , so we pick it to be the root node
- then split the tree to (left , right) leaves
- for each leaf , we repeat the process of splitting for each feature then pick the feature with the least SSR
- continue the process of splitting until we cannot split the data anymore
