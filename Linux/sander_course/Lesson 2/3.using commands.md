### Explain the man command pages
- there are many sections in the man command lets discuss it 

1. **name of the command**
2. **Synopsis** : options that U can use in the command 
3. **Description** : description of the command 
4. **Table Of Sections** : each section represent a function of the command , its like a chapter in a book and each chapter defines its own thing

#### Summary of **man** Command
- items between brackets are optional to use
- if you see a|b or {a|b} so you must choose
- And ...  means that you have more than a predicted item
- *man page have sections*
-  1 - end user command
-  5 - is for configure files
-  8 - is for administrator commands
- /sometext --> to search for some text in the man command

## the problem is which man command to use
- then we need to see the man database page
- man index is created an a mandb 
- we can use man -k to know which apropos to use 
<br>
- The  database  searched by apropos is updated by the mandb program.  
- Depending on your installation, this may be run by a periodic cron job, or may need to be  run manually after new manual pages have been installed
<br>
- when we have a lot of output on the screen we can use **pipe ( | : or operator)** and choose less 
- we can also use **grep** --> search for a specific thing in the page
