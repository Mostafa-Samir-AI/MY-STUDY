# what is **Data structure** ? 
- <u>data structure are different ways of organizing data on your computer </u>
- from the software POV the efficiency and the performance of the software  , depends on how the data is organized , stored and grouped together during the program  

# what is **Algorithm** ?
- <u>set of instruction to accomplish a task</u>
- **in computer science** an *Algorithm* is set of rules for computer program to accomplish a task    

# why algorithm and data structure ?
- its a lot easier to process data when its well organized 


# <u>Types of Data Structures in Python</u>

| primitive                                                              | non-primitive                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cannot be broken into simpler form                                     | more complex can be broken into smaller data type                                                             |
| primitive data structure have fixed size (smaller than non -primitive) | can be large in size and can grow or shrink dynamically                                                       |
| integer , float , string , Boolean                                     | *Linear*: list , tuple , array , linked list , stack , queue  / *non-linear*: set , dictionary , tree , graph |
| used in simple operations                                              | used in complex operations like sorting                                                                       |
| represented in memory as simple values                                 | represented in memory as pointers to other memory location                                                    |

- **linear data structure** : arranged in sequential order , where each element is connected to the adjacent element
- **non-linear data structure** : not arranged in sequential order , used to hierarchical relationship between data and elements 
## we can classify data structure in python like :-
| build in                                                           | user defined                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| we do not need to use an external library to use it                | we need to use external library to be able to use them |
| list , tuples , dictionaries , sets , and primitive data structure | other non-primitive                                                        |

# <u>Types of Algorithms in Python</u> 

| algorithm           | usage                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sorting             | to sort data in ascending or dscending order                                                                              |
| Search              | to find specific value in in a data set                                                                                   |
| Graph               | to work with data that can be represented as a graph                                                                      |
| Dynamic programming | to solve the problem by breaking it into small sub-problems                                                               |
| Divide and conquer  | to solve the problem by breaking it into small sub-problems , solve each problem independently then combining the results |
| Recursive           | to solve the problem by breaking it into small sub-problems that are similar in nature                                    |
