# how deep learning work ?
- we need to build a model that take input and extract features than make decision 
- the input will be datasets 
- the processing will take place in many layers of deep learning 
- the output will be decision made by the deep learning model 
<br>
- layers work with math functions 
- every layer have input and gives the output for the next layer 

# Tensor
- **tensor** : multi-D array 
- **array** : ordered arrangement of numbers

## arrays based on dimensionality
- we will talk about arrays in the concept of tensors
### 1. 0D Tensors
- 0D tensors that contains only one element
- array that contain one element
- Ex : [8] , [0] 
### 2. 1D tensor
- 1D tensors are also called vectors
- only have one dimension 
- array that contains series of elements
- it can be called also a matrix that contains 1 row or column
- EX : [1,2,3,5,9,6,7,8]

### 3. 2D tensors
- its called a matrix that contains n.m rows and columns
- its not allowed to have a matrix that have 1 or 0 row or column
- ex: [ [1,2,3] , [5,8,7]] --> matrix (2 * 3)
### 4. 3D tensors
- a tensor is a series of matrices 
- Ex : [ [ [1,2,3] , [5,8,7]] , [ [1,2,3] , [5,8,7]] ] --> series of 2 matrices
### 5. nD tensors 
- are series of matrices and n-1 tensors
