### difference between machine learning and ordinary programming

- **machine learning** : application of AI , computer observe and analysis then predict based on previous pattern

# supervised machine learning
- The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to best estimate the mapping function (f) for the output variable (Y) given the input data (X).  
- The mapping function is often called the target function because it is the function that a given supervised machine learning algorithm aims to approximate.
- there are 2 approaches in supervised machine learning
	1. regression
	2. classification
## Regression
- the target is continuous value --> output is continuous
- predict the relationship between dependent (y) and independent (x) values
- ***Regression Problem*** try to learn the real numerical value of the class, such as “dollars” or “weight” or “size”.
## Classification
- the target value is discrete value
- It is a predictive modelling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.
- ***Classification problem*** try to learn categorical class. such as “red” or “blue” or “yellow”
