# **Mathematical Understanding of SVM (Support Vector Machine)**

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised learning algorithm primarily used for **classification**, but it can also be used for **regression**. This explanation focuses on the mathematical foundations of SVM.

---

## **1. Core Idea of SVM**
SVM aims to find the **optimal hyperplane** that best separates different classes in a multi-dimensional space by maximizing the **margin** between them. The **margin** is the distance between the closest points from each class to the decision boundary.

### **Basic Assumptions:**
- The data is **linearly separable**: A straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) can separate the classes completely.
- The closest points to the decision boundary are called **support vectors**, and they define the hyperplane.

---

## **2. Finding the Decision Boundary Mathematically**
Given a dataset of $n$ training points:

$$
(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)
$$

where:
- $x_i$ is the **feature vector** in $d$ dimensions.
- $y_i$ is the **class label**, taking values in $\{+1, -1\}$.

### **2.1 Defining the Hyperplane**
The decision boundary is given by:

$$
w^T x + b = 0
$$

where:
- $w$ is the **weight vector**.
- $b$ is the **bias term**.

### **2.2 Constraints for Linear Separation**
To correctly classify all points, they must satisfy:

$$
y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1, \quad \forall i
$$

### **2.3 Defining the Margin**
The distance from any point $x$ to the hyperplane is:

$$
\frac{|w^T x + b|}{\|w\|}
$$

The total margin between the closest support vectors from both classes is:

$$
\frac{2}{\|w\|}
$$

Maximizing this margin is equivalent to minimizing $ \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 $ for mathematical convenience.

---

## **3. Solving as an Optimization Problem**
Thus, the optimization problem becomes:

$$
\min_{w, b} \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2
$$

subject to:

$$
y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1, \quad \forall i
$$

This is a **convex optimization problem**, which can be solved using **Lagrange multipliers**.

---

## **4. Handling Non-Separable Data (Soft Margin)**
When there is **overlapping between classes**, **slack variables** ($\xi_i$) allow for misclassifications:

$$
y_i (w^T x_i + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i, \quad \forall i
$$

The objective function includes a penalty term:

$$
\min_{w, b} \frac{1}{2} \|w\|^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i
$$

where $C$ controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing misclassification errors.

---

## **5. Non-Linear SVM (Kernel Trick)**
For non-linearly separable data, **Kernel Trick** maps data to a **higher-dimensional space** where it becomes linearly separable. Instead of using the traditional dot product:

$$
w^T x
$$

we replace it with a **kernel function**:

$$
K(x_i, x_j) = \phi(x_i)^T \phi(x_j)
$$

where $\phi(x)$ is a non-linear transformation.

### **Common Kernel Functions:**
1. **Linear Kernel:**
   $$
   K(x_i, x_j) = x_i^T x_j
   $$
2. **Polynomial Kernel:**
   $$
   K(x_i, x_j) = (x_i^T x_j + c)^d
   $$
3. **Gaussian RBF (Radial Basis Function):**
   $$
   K(x_i, x_j) = \exp(-\gamma \|x_i - x_j\|^2)
   $$
4. **Sigmoid Kernel:**
   $$
   K(x_i, x_j) = \tanh(\alpha x_i^T x_j + c)
   $$

---

## **6. Making Predictions with SVM**
After training, the prediction for a new point $x$ is:

$$
\hat{y} = \text{sign}(w^T x + b)
$$

or using the kernelized form:

$$
\hat{y} = \text{sign} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b \right)
$$

where:
- $\alpha_i$ are **Lagrange multipliers** found during training.

---

## **Conclusion**
- **SVM finds the optimal decision boundary** that maximizes the margin between classes.
- **The problem is solved using convex optimization techniques like Lagrange multipliers**.
- **For non-linearly separable data, Kernel Trick maps it to a higher-dimensional space**.
- **The final model is efficient, especially for high-dimensional data**.
