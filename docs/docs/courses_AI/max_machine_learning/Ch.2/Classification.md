# Classification
 - what we will cover 
	1. what is classification
	2. how does the logistic regression work
	3. how does logistic regression learn
	4. Binary , Multi-label and multi class Classification 

# what is Classification ?
- predict categories in data
- Looking for groups in data (may be clustring)

- classification algorithms divide the data into groups (classifying the data)

# When do you use them ?
- work on discrete values 
- target value must be discrete value
- we use it when we are interested in an attribute
- when yo don't need numerical value as a target
<br>
**Example**
- if we have many photos , that are grouped into {"dogs" , "Cats"} 
- we as humans learned how to differ each of "dogs" and "cats" by recognizing the morphology
- the machine learning algorithm do the same , according to attributes in the data the machine leaning can differ between both of "dogs" and "cats" by some attributes 
> it might be more than 2 groups
