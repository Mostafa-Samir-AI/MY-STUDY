### Development of Linux Distributions
#### 1. Red hat 
- red hat become the first successful Linux distribution 
- based on the **Red Hat** , there are some distros that depend on red hat such as : *CentOS* and *Fedora* 
- *Fedora* : feeds on CentOS 
- *CentOS* : continuous open source distro developed by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
- **Red Hat** : is the most successful Distro in the family
- So , lets recap `1.Fedora --> 2.CentOS --> 3.Red Hat`
- Red Hat costs , so there are some distros from red hat tghat are free such as : *Rocky* , *Alma*
- there is another Linux distro from the Red Hat family and its **Oracle Linux**

#### 2. Debian 
- have many important distro derived from like : *Ubuntu** 
- from *Ubuntu* derived *Kali* and *Mint*
- **Kali** : is more security oriented
- **mint** : have nice graphical interface 

- there are many distros but these two is the main distros in this moment
