-  there are more than man and pinfo for getting help
### Some notes
- <u> you better use man instead of google  </u> because man is modified for your system and distro while google is showing you un-updated configurations (never use it)
- *pinfo* show you usage of soem commands
- *command --help* same in provoding help
> If you know the command use --help , if you do not know the command use man 
<br>
- */usr/share/doc* another way ti know the command and what should it do 
in some cases this is useful and in some other its useless
- *tldr* : its relatively new and it shows commands with example
