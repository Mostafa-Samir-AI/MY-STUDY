# Working with sudo and su 
- to work with Linux you need to log in 
- in *Debian* when you setup the OS you are already a root (administrator) user 
- in *Red Hat* : there are options , You sign in with an administrator and then you create a user and give him privileges 
- alternative of using sudo you can sign in to the root user 
- its **not recommended** to work as a root , because a root user have many privileges that could be dangrous if used wrongly 
- you use root privileges when you really need it , may be sudo user
- in order to login you can use Console  , GUI or remotely (establishing SSH connection)

# privileges of Linux 
- normal user : limit privileges 
- root user : have administrator privileges 
- old days of Linux there were *root* and *normal* users , and root user is unrestricted 
- in modern Linux root user is Disabled (they don't set password for root so that U cannot login)
- so you need to use sudo 
- members in group *wheel --> Red hat* or *sudo --> ubuntu* are can use sudo to run commands with administrator privileges 

# commands
- first command is `su -`
```bash
# generic command allows U to open shell as another user
su -
```
- generic command allows U to open shell as another user
- used to configure setups for all users
- `-` :  make sure that the new shell is started as login shell and in the login shell U have full access to variables that make the user environment  
- if you used `su` without the `-` it will open the current shell as a login shell , it will happen if the root is enabled
- it will require password --> it will be the password for the root 
- it you get a prompt `Authentication failure` so there is no password provided to root 

# Sudo
- user must be in the sudo group in Ubuntu or wheel in red hat
- sudo allows authorized users to run tasks with privileges 
- to use sudo ,  `sudo` + Command
```bash
# command shows you if sudo works for the user like you
sudo ls /root
```

- when using a command we can use options with it
- there is *long options* `--` and there is a *short option* `-`
