### Q1
- what is the time complexity of the following code
```python
def print_items(a,b):
	for i in range(a):
		print(i)
	for j in range(b):
		print(j)
```

**- Answer**
- for this specific code , its similar to the case O(n)
- but O(n) is wrong 
**+** for the $1^{st}$ loop it will be `O(a)` , $2^{nd}$ loop it will be `O(b)` &rarr; &rarr; &rarr;  `O ( a + b )`
