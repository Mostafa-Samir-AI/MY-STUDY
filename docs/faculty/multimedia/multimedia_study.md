## classification of multimedia data 
 - taking 3 aspects when classifying multimedia: 
 - we classify multimedia based on :-
		1- time-dimension
		2- online vs non-online 
		3- analog vs digital 

### Time dimension 
 - classified into :-
 
| time independent | time dependant            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Discrete         | Continuous                |
| text , Graphs    | Audio , video , animation |
  
### online vs Offline 
| online Delivery                                         | offline Delivery                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| - uses a network to send information                    | - carry information in removable storage |
| - web and cables network are online delivery multimedia | - carried on CD , ROM , DVD              | 

### Analog vs Digital 
| Analog                              | Digital                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| - continuous representation of data | Discrete representation of the data | 

- **Analog format** : the time-varying feature (variable) of the signal is a continuous representation of the input

## Analog Vs Digital

- We live in an analog world.
- Everything in the physical world is an **analog signal**
- sensing (sound , light , pressure , Temperature and motion) exists in continuous form 

- BUT *digital devices* measures information in digital form 
- So ,  the analog signals must be converted into digital (***Digitalization***)
- Special <u>hardware devices</u> called **Analog-to-Digital** converters perform this task.(***Digitalization***)
- for <u>playback</u> **Digital to analog** must perform converse operation. 

`note`
```
- Text, Graphics and some images are generated directly by computer and do not require digitizing
- they are generated directly in binary format.
```

### Advantage of **Digital** signals over Analog
 
 1- digital signal, it is possible to create complex, interactive content.
 2- Stored digital signals do not degrade over time or distance as analog signals do
 3- Digital data can be efficiently compressed and transmitted across digital networks.
 4- It easy to store all types of digital media on a common storage medium. 

## Multimedia representation

### <u>how the information is represented ?</u> 

 - The encoding process in different file formats is important as it relates to 
	 - storage 
	 - interactivity
	 - reproducibility
	 - security
	 - transmission of the data.

- <u>encoding of some files</u>
		- Text is encoded in *ASCII*
		- An audio data stream in *PCM*
		- image in *JPEG* format.
		- Video in *MPEG* format.

## what is sound ? 

- **sound** : a continuous wave that travels or moves through the air
- The wave is made up of pressure differences. 
- Sound is detected by measuring the pressure level at a location
- Sound can be measured by converting pressure to voltage levels.
- Sound waves have normal properties such as (reflection, refraction, diffraction)

- sound wave is an analog signal.
- **Analog signal** (sound) : continuous measurement of pressure wave.
- pressure wave can change periodic and aperiodic (**compressions** and **rarefactions**)

##### Sound is a complex relationship involve  
- vibrating object (sound source).
- transmission medium (usually air).
- receiver (human ear)
- preceptor (human brain ) 

##### The interpretation of sound by human beings is a very complex process involves three systems:
- **source** 
- **medium**
- **detector** 

## Sound wave attributes 

### Amplitude 
- **amplitude** : <u>Measure of displacement of the air pressure wave from its mean</u>
- The louder sound is with the higher amplitude.
- For a digital sound, amplitude is the sample value.

### waveform
- **waveform** : <u>is a plot of amplitude against time.</u>
- Waveform provides a graphical view of characteristics of a changing sound

### Period 
- **period** : <u>is the interval at which a periodic signal repeats regularly.</u> OR  <u>Period: time for cycle to occur.</u>
- Period = (1/frequency).

### loudness 
- **loudness** : <u>is representing the quality of the sound.</u>
- <u>The reason that sounds have different loudness</u> is that they carry **different amount of power**
- The unit of power is **watt**
- **Intensity of sound** : is the amount of power transmitted through an area of `1m2` oriented perpendicular to the *propagation* direction of the sound.
- threshold of feeling = 1watt/m2
- threshold of hearing = 10.power(-12) watt/m2 
- The intensity of two different sounds is measured using the unit *Bel* or more commonly **deciBel (dB).**

### frequency 
- **Frequency**: <u>the number of cycles a sound wave creates in one second. </u>
- measuring unit: cycles/second OR (cycles per second) / Hz
- Frequency measures a physical property of a wave.
- f = 1/T --> It is the reciprocal value of period

##### thresholds of frequency 
- Infrasound: 0 - 20Hz
- Human hearing range: 20 Hz – 20 kHz
- Ultrasound: 20KHz- 1GHz
- Hypersound: 1GHz - 10THz

### Dynamic range 
- **Dynamic range** : <u>means the change in sound levels.</u>

### Bandwidth
- **Bandwidth** <u>is the range of frequencies a device can produce, or a human can hear</u>
- FM radio: 50Hz – 15kHz
- Children’s ears: 20Hz – 20kHz
- Older ears: 50Hz – 10kHz

## digitalization of sound 

### why digitalize sound ? 
- sound wave are analog signals 
- computer cannot understand analog signals only digital so it should be converted to digital signals
- Microphones, video cameras produce analog signals (continuous-valued voltages).
- To store audio or video data into a computer, we must digitize it by converting it into a stream of numbers.
- **Digitization** :  means conversion to a stream of numbers

### steps for Digitalization
#### 1- sampling 
###### includes  
- **measuring** : the analog signal at discrete intervals
- **Recording** : the values at these points 

##### how many samples to take ? 
- Telephone : 11.025 KHz
- AM radio : 22.05 KHz
- CD : 44.1 KHz 

#### 2- Quantization

- **Quantization** : <u>divide the vertical axis (signal strength - voltage) into pieces. </u>
- 8-bit quantization divides the vertical axis into 256 levels. { 2.power(8) }

| sampling                                   | Quantization                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| dividing the analog signals in **time** domain | dividing the analog signal in **amplitude** domain |

#### 3- Coding 
- **PCM coding (Pulse Code Modulation)**
- Encoding each N-level value to a m-bit binary digit.
- **The precision of the digital audio sample** is determined by the number of bits per sample, typically 8 or 16 bits.

### Quantization error

- **Quantization noise**
-  is the difference between *the actual value of the analog signal at the sampling time* and the nearest *quantization interval value*
- If we use too <u>few levels to represent each sample value</u>, there will be *large amount of error for each sample*.
- These errors can be thought of as *noise on the signal*.

## sample and hold reconstruction
- After being processed by the computer, the signal will be played back 
- we need to reconstruct the signal from the digital representation. 
- One commonly used technique is known as **sample and hold.** 

# lecture 4 

- Notice that decibels are always defined in terms of a ratio.
- The levels of sound we hear around us are described in terms of decibels, as a ratio to the quietest sound we are capable of hearing.
##### some ratios we need to know
		- Threshold of hearing    : 0 db
		- Threshold of discomfort : 120 db
		- Threshold of pain       : 140 db
		- damage of eardrum       : 160 db

## SNR

- In any analog system – continuous random amplitude produce noise added to the signal, and the measured voltage is also incorrect.

**SNR** : <u>signal to noise ratio</u> OR <u>The ratio of the power of the correct signal to the power of the noise.</u> 

- The SNR is a measure of the quality of the signal.
- The SNR is usually measured in decibels (dB). 

## SQNR
- For digital signals - only quantized values are stored.
- For a digital audio signal, the accuracy (Precision) of each sample is determined by the number of bits per sample, typically 8 or 16 bits.
- Additional error results from quantization called **quantization error**
**SQNR** : characterize the quality of quantization. **Signal to Quantization error ratio**
